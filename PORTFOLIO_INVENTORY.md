## Category Definitions

### CORE (3 repos)
Production-ready, actively used in daily workflow. These are the foundation of current operations.

### PROMISING (6 repos)
Working code that could become standalone products or libraries. Have real functionality but need consolidation or focus.

### EXPERIMENT (4 repos)
Early-stage ideas with minimal working code, mostly documentation. Useful as "code mines" for patterns but not for active development.

### ARCHIVE (6 repos)
Empty placeholders, unmodified forks, or inactive projects. Candidates for deletion or archival.

## Portfolio Distribution

```
CORE:       3 repos (16%)
PROMISING:  6 repos (32%)
EXPERIMENT: 4 repos (21%)
ARCHIVE:    6 repos (31%)
```

---

## Key Findings

1. **Focus is scattered** - 13 active or semi-active repos across multiple domains (voice AI, DevOps, maintenance, automation)
2. **Duplication exists** - 3 Friday variants, jarvis-core overlaps with Agent-Factory
3. **6 repos are dead weight** - Empty or unmodified forks adding no value
4. **2 strong foundations** - Agent-Factory and Backlog.md are production-ready CORE systems
5. **Consolidation needed** - Friday variants should merge, jarvis-core should absorb into Agent-Factory

## Recommended Actions

See **STRANGLER_RULES.md** for the consolidation strategy and **PRODUCTS.md** for the target product architecture.
