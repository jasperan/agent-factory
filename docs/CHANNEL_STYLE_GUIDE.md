## 1. Overview & Philosophy {#overview}

### Core Principles
1. **Precision & Clarity** - Industrial content demands accuracy
2. **Satisfying Aesthetics** - Leverage psychological triggers (symmetry, completion)
3. **Modern Minimalism** - Clean, high-contrast, uncluttered
4. **Mobile-First** - 70%+ views on phones, optimize for 9:16
5. **Template Consistency** - 80% adherence, 20% creative variation

### Target Audience Psychology
- **Technicians:** Want accurate, no-BS info
- **Apprentices:** Need clear, step-by-step visuals
- **Hobbyists:** Inspired by "cool factor" and satisfying visuals
- **Students:** Engage with modern editing, fast pacing

---

## 2. Color System {#colors}

### Primary Palette
- **Industrial Blue:** `#1E3A8A` (Deep blue, trustworthy, technical)
- **Safety Orange:** `#F97316` (Accent, warnings, emphasis)

### Secondary Palette
- **Neutral Dark:** `#1F2937` (Backgrounds, text blocks)
- **Neutral Light:** `#F3F4F6` (Light backgrounds, contrast)
- **Success Green:** `#10B981` (Correct answers, completions)
- **Warning Yellow:** `#F59E0B` (Caution, important notes)
- **Error Red:** `#EF4444` (Errors, dangers, stop actions)

### Usage Rules
- **Backgrounds:** 90% neutral (dark for videos, light for diagrams)
- **Text:** High contrast only (white on dark, dark on light)
- **Accents:** Safety Orange for CTAs, callouts, emphasis (max 10% of frame)
- **Color Grading:** Slight desaturation for realism, vibrant accents for emphasis

### Color Psychology
- Blue = Reliability, technical expertise

---

## 4. Motion Design {#motion}

### Transition Timing
- **Fade:** 0.3s (standard transition)
- **Cross-dissolve:** 0.5s (between major sections)
- **Hard cut:** 0s (on beat, for energy)
- **Zoom in:** 0.4s (focus on detail)
- **Slide wipe:** 0.3s (horizontal, left to right)

### Animation Principles
- **Ease curves:** Always use ease-in-out (no linear)
- **Anticipation:** 0.1s pause before major transitions
- **Follow-through:** 0.1s overshoot on zoom/slide, then settle
- **Slow-motion:** 50% speed for satisfying moments (gears meshing, perfect fits)

### Camera Movements
- **Push in:** Slow zoom (3s duration) to focus on detail
- **Pull out:** Reveal context after detail shot
- **Pan:** Smooth, 2-3s duration, follow action
- **Static:** Hold on satisfying visuals for 3-5s (let viewer absorb)

### Visual Effects
- **Grid overlay:** Subtle 10x10 grid, 20% opacity, for precision shots
- **Measurement callouts:** Animated lines with dimensions (0.3s draw)
- **Highlight glow:** 5px orange glow around important elements
- **Motion blur:** 2-frame blur on fast movements (more cinematic)

---

## 5. Audio Design {#audio}

### Music Guidelines
- **Genre:** Electronic minimal, lo-fi beats, ambient industrial
- **BPM Range:** 100-120 (energetic but not frantic)
- **Volume:** -18dB (background, never overpowers narration)
- **Cuts:** Always on beat (align transitions to music)

### Narration Style
- **Voice:** Calm, authoritative, friendly (Edge-TTS: Guy)
- **Pace:** 140-150 WPM (words per minute)
- **Pauses:** 0.5s between sentences, 1s between sections
- **Emphasis:** Slight volume increase (+2dB) on key terms

### Sound Effects
- **Transition whoosh:** Subtle, -12dB
- **Reveal sound:** Satisfying "pop" or "click", -10dB
- **Error beep:** Clear, attention-grabbing, -8dB
- **Success chime:** Positive, brief, -10dB

### ASMR Integration
- **Machinery sounds:** Authentic, captured at source, -15dB
- **Texture focus:** Amplify subtle sounds (screws tightening, switches clicking)
- **Foley:** Add satisfying sounds to silent moments

## 7. "Oddly Satisfying" Patterns {#satisfying}

### Symmetry Reveals
- **Bilateral:** Perfect mirror images (motor assemblies, control panels)
- **Radial:** Circular patterns (gears, rotors, bearings)
- **Rotational:** 360-degree spins showing perfect balance

**Implementation:**
- Start asymmetric, reveal symmetry over 2-3s
- Slow-motion (50% speed) during reveal
- Grid overlay to emphasize precision

### Precision Moments
- **Perfect Fits:** Close-ups of components sliding into place (0.001" tolerance)
- **Alignment:** Showing perfect parallel lines, right angles, concentricity
- **Tight Tolerances:** Machined surfaces, smooth finishes, mirror polish

**Implementation:**
- Zoom in 200% on moment of perfection
- Hold for 2-3s (let satisfaction sink in)
- Subtle "click" sound effect

### Repetitive Hypnotic Loops
- **Synchronized Machines:** Multiple units operating in unison
- **Rhythmic Motions:** Conveyor belts, pistons, rotating assemblies
- **Perfect Timing:** Actions synced to music beat

**Implementation:**
- Loop 3-5 times before moving on
- Match loop timing to music BPM
- Slight speed ramp (98% → 100% → 98%) for organic feel

### Satisfying Endings
- **Clean Completion:** Part fully assembled, circuit fully tested
- **Before/After:** Dirty → Clean, Broken → Fixed, Chaos → Order
- **Final Click:** Latch closing, button pressing, switch flipping

**Implementation:**
- Always end tutorials with satisfying completion shot
- Hold on final state for 3s
- Success chime sound effect

## 8. Content Formatting {#formatting}

### Shorts (<60s)
- **Structure:** Hook (0-3s) → Concept (4-40s) → Payoff (41-60s)
- **Hook examples:**
  - "This mistake costs $10K..."
  - "You've been doing this wrong..."
  - Immediate visual grab (explosion, failure, precision shot)
- **Pacing:** Fast cuts (3-5s per shot), energetic music
- **Payoff:** Satisfying conclusion, clear answer, visual wow

### Tutorials (5-10 min)
- **Structure:** Intro (0-30s) → Steps (1-2 min each) → Recap (last 30s)
- **Intro:** Problem statement + what you'll learn
- **Steps:** Title card → demonstration → key points overlay
- **Recap:** Summarize 3-5 main points, CTA

### Series (3-5 episodes)
- **Episode Structure:** Recap previous (15s) → New concept → Cliff hanger/teaser for next
- **Progression:** Simple → Complex (each episode builds on previous)
- **Callbacks:** Reference previous episodes visually (show earlier clips)

## 9. Variation Guidelines {#variation}

### 80% Template Adherence
- Always use approved color palette

- **Camera angles:** Different perspectives on same subject
- **Music tempo:** Vary BPM ±10 for mood
- **Visual metaphors:** Creative analogies for concepts
- **Seasonal themes:** Holiday colors (10% accent only)

**Forbidden Variations:**

## 10. 2025 Trend Integration {#trends}

### K-Pop Editing Style
- **Synchronized Cuts:** Align every cut to music beat (use BPM calculator)
- **Rhythmic Repetitions:** Show same action 3x with slight variations
- **Vibrant Shifts:** Quick color grade changes (warm → cool → neutral)

**When to use:** High-energy shorts, satisfying compilations

### Mobile-First Framing
- **9:16 Vertical:** Default aspect ratio for shorts
- **Thumb Zones:** CTA buttons at bottom 1/3 of screen
- **Text Placement:** Top 1/3 or bottom 1/3 (avoid center)

**When to use:** All shorts, mobile-targeted content

### Minimalist Aesthetics
- **White Space:** 30-40% of frame is empty (focus viewer attention)
- **Single Focus:** One element per frame (don't clutter)
- **High Contrast:** Pure black/white for impact

**When to use:** Concept explanations, diagrams, technical breakdowns

### ASMR-Tinged Narration
- **Whisper Mode:** Soft narration over machinery sounds
- **Pause for Ambient:** Let machine sounds play solo for 2-3s
- **Layered Audio:** Narration + subtle machine + minimal music

**When to use:** Detailed procedures, relaxing/satisfying content
